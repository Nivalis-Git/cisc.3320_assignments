--------Problem Statement:
Write a program that uses the fork system command to create a child process. Then have that child process use fork to create its own child progress.
	Each process should print its PID and a string indicating which process it is in english.


--------Assumptions Made:
I have but one assumption: that the order in which the tasks are given are not the order in which they must be completed. Meaning I can create the GC process and print its data as the last step, rather than creating the GC process before any printing has taken place.
	This is a trivial assumption, but important as an example of the kind of clarification needed when a particular order of progression is desired.
