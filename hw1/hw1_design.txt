Assignment 1, 3320 CISC
Shterenberg, Simon

----Introduction----
The code structure required for this assignment has a complexity of "near-zero", so the only module described here is the main execution body.

In this version I seek to first create all the processes before doing any printing.


--------main
----Parameters
None.

----Purpose
Create a unary tree of processes with three levels. Then have each process print an identifying string.

----Structure
I. Intialize all prerequisite variables and conditions

II. Fork, and split execution between the level 1 and the level 2 process.
	i. Print with the level 1 process.
	
	ii. Fork the level 2 process.
		a. Print with the level 2 process.
		b. Print with the level 3 process.

III. End of program.
